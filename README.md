# Lunges Counter App




## Overview

This is a Lunges Counter App built using Kotlin for Android native development and powered by [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/). The app utilizes angle measurement to count lunges accurately. In the future, there are plans to train a separate machine learning model to improve and enhance the accuracy of lunge detection.

## Features

- Counts lunges using angle measurement.
- User-friendly and intuitive interface.
- Accurate lunge counting for workout tracking.
- Plans for future improvements with a dedicated lunges detection model.

## Usage
- Launch the Lunges Counter App on your Android device.
- Stand in a well lit area and position where your entire body is visible to the camera.
- Perform lunges, and the app will count them using angle measurement.
- Monitor your lunge count in real-time.

## Limitations of this app
- May not count properly if full body is not visible.
- Mediapipe model fluctuates and is not stable in bad lighting conditions so count may change.

## Future Enhancements
In the future, we could improve the app by implementing a dedicated machine learning model to detect lunges. This will provide even more accurate lunge counting and enhance the user experience. This approach was not taken due to the lack of training data right now.
